# 🚀 My Flask Learning Journey: Task 1

### The Story
I recently started my journey into backend development with **Python and Flask**. Like every beginner, I began by setting up my environment—dealing with virtual environments and understanding how a local server communicates with a browser.

This repository marks my first official task! After learning the basics of routing and handling requests, I built this application to practice how data flows from a URL query into my Python logic.

### 🔍 What this App Does
This is a Flask-based web tool that:
1.  **Captures User Data**: It looks for a `name` parameter in the URL.
2.  **Processes Logic**: It takes that name and converts it into **UPPER CASE**.
3.  **Creative Bonuses**: 
    * **Text Reverser**: A fun tool that flips any name or string backward.
    * **Character Counter**: A utility that tells you exactly how many letters are in your text.

### 🛠️ How I Built It
* **Backend**: Python 3.x
* **Framework**: Flask
* **Environment**: Managed via `venv` (Virtual Environment)
* **Security**: Handled PowerShell execution policies to ensure a smooth dev setup.
